I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in economics at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-economics) and [Helsinki GSE](https://www.helsinkigse.fi/), under the supervision of [Otto Toivanen](https://www.aalto-econ.fi/toivanen/), [Tanja Saxell](https://sites.google.com/site/tsaxell/) and [Ciprian Domnisoru](https://www.cipriandomnisoru.net/). 

I work on industrial organization and health economics. Currently, I use individual-level administrative data and structural models to study markets with public and private healthcare providers. 

**I will be on the 2024--2025 academic job market.**

### Research

#### Job Market Paper
- Cutting the Queue to the Dentist: Waiting Time, Public-Private Interaction and Consumer Surplus [(paper)](https://tuomasmarkkula.github.io/files/markkula_JMP.pdf)
  
 <p> <sub>In industries where private and public production coexist, public production can incentivize private competition and address distributional concerns. Using a structural model that incorporates affordable but capacity-constrained public healthcare producers into a framework with price-setting private producers and consumer demand, I examine how increasing public production's capacity affects waiting times, private practices' prices, and the distribution of consumer surplus. I estimate the model using consumer-level visit data on the Finnish dental care industry. In the counterfactual simulation, I increase the number of dentists in public practices by 20\%. This reduces waiting times at public practices on average by 5\%, or 1.5 days, but does not affect private practice prices as consumers do not switch from private to public practices. The increase in capacity most benefits middle-income and younger consumers, as they gain the most from shorter public practice waiting times.<sub/> <p/>
