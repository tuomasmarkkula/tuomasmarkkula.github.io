I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [University of Hamburg](https://www.wiso.uni-hamburg.de/en/fachbereich-vwl.html) and the [Hamburg Center for Health Economics](https://www.hche.uni-hamburg.de/en.html). I obtained my PhD from [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-economics) and [Helsinki GSE](https://www.helsinkigse.fi/), under the supervision of [Otto Toivanen](https://www.aalto-econ.fi/toivanen/), [Tanja Saxell](https://sites.google.com/site/tsaxell/) and [Ciprian Domnisoru](https://www.cipriandomnisoru.net/). 

I work on industrial organization, health economics, and public economics. Currently, I use individual-level administrative data and structural models to study markets with public and private healthcare providers.

### Research

#### Job Market Paper
- Cutting the Queue to the Dentist: Waiting Time, Public-Private Interaction and Consumer Surplus [(paper)](https://tuomasmarkkula.github.io/files/markkula_JMP.pdf)
  
 <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; margin-left: 40px;"> <sub>In industries where private and public production coexist, public production can incentivize private competition and address distributional concerns. However, affordable public services often face demand that exceeds supply, leading to long waiting times. Meanwhile, private options allow consumers to pay more to avoid waiting, raising equity issues. I examine how increasing public production's capacity affects waiting times, private practices' prices, and the distribution of consumer surplus using a structural model incorporating affordable but capacity-constrained public health care producers into a framework with price-setting private producers and consumer demand. I estimate the model using consumer-level visit data on the Finnish dental care industry. In the counterfactual simulation, I increase the number of dentists in public practices by 20%. This reduces waiting times at public practices on average by 5%, or 1.5 days, but does not affect private practice prices as consumers do not switch from private to public practices. Consumer surplus and the use of dental care services increase, but the increase is less for the lowest income decile. <sub/> <p/>
