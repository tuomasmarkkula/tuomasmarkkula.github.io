I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in economics at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-economics) and [Helsinki GSE](https://www.helsinkigse.fi/), under the supervision of [Otto Toivanen](https://www.aalto-econ.fi/toivanen/), [Tanja Saxell](https://sites.google.com/site/tsaxell/) and [Ciprian Domnisoru](https://www.cipriandomnisoru.net/). 

I work on industrial organization and health economics. Currently, I use individual-level administrative data and structural models to study markets with public and private healthcare providers. 

**I will be on the 2024--2025 academic job market.**

### Research

#### Job Market Paper
- Cutting the Queue to the Dentist: Waiting Time, Public-Private Interaction and Consumer Surplus [paper](https://tuomasmarkkula.github.io/files/markkula_JMP.pdf)

<style>body {text-align: justify}</style>
<small>In many industries, private and public production coexist. Public production can address possible failures of private production by incentivizing private competition and by addressing distributional concerns. In a healthcare setting, consumers must typically wait for affordable public services but can cut the queue by paying more for a private alternative. I study how increasing the production capacity of public practicesâ€™ affects waiting times, private practice prices, and the distribution of consumer surplus. I use individual-level data on the Finnish dental care industry and build a structural model that introduces capacity-constrained public producers into a framework with consumer demand, and price-setting private producers. In the counterfactual, I increase the number of dentists working at public practices by 20%. The increase in capacity decreases waiting times at public practices on average by 5% or 1.5 days but does not affect the prices of private practices as consumers do not switch from private practices to public practices. The increase in capacity leads to the largest increases in consumer surplus for middle-income consumers and for the youngest consumers, as they benefit the most from the decrease in waiting times.<small/>
